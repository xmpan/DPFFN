# DPFFN: A Dual-Polarization Feature Fusion Network for Radar Automatic Target Recognition

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of **DPFFN**, a novel deep learning framework designed for radar automatic target recognition (RATR) using High-Resolution Range Profile (HRRP) sequences under dual-polarization settings. DPFFN extracts and fuses global-local features across HH and VH channels to improve classification performance.

## üîç Overview

DPFFN introduces a two-branch architecture to exploit both **global structural semantics** and **local scattering details**. Key innovations include:

- **Dual-Polarization Tokenization**: Separately processes HH and VH HRRP signals into feature tokens.
- **Global and Local Subnetworks**: Captures complementary characteristics at different semantic levels.
- **Two-Stage Feature Fusion**: Integrates features hierarchically across polarizations and semantic scales.
- **Fusion Loss**: Enhances consistency and discriminability across modalities.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xmpan/DPFFN.git
cd DPFFN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

Please prepare your HRRP dataset in the format `[Batch, Sequence Length, Channel]`, e.g., `[N, 512, 401]` for HH/VH channels. Update the path and format loader in `data/data.py`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We do not distribute radar data due to security and copyright restrictions.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è But we distribute one sample for each class for an test example.

### Training

```bash
python train.py
```

### Evaluation

```bash
python test.py
```

This will evaluate the model and generate confusion matrices and performance metrics.
